            <p class="card-text">About Us , a part of Coffee Day Global Limited, is India’s favourite hangout for coffee and conversations. Popularly known as CCD, we strive to provide the best experience to our guests. Our coffees are sourced from thousands of small coffee planters, who made us who we are today and we're glad to be a part of their lives. We opened our first cafe in 1996 at Brigade Road in Bangalore – the youth and the young at heart immediately took to the cafe, and it continues to be one of the most happening places in the city. CCD to the youth is a “hangout” spot where they meet people, make conversations, and have a whole lot of fun over steaming cups of great coffee.It's been an exciting journey since then to becoming the largest organised retail cafe chain in the country. We’re also present in Austria, Czech Republic and Malaysia, so if your travel takes you there, do stop by our outlets to get a taste from back home!</p>

Café Coffee Day, a coffee shop filled with fun, young energy and lots of entertainment! Popularly known as CCD, we strive to provide the best experience to our guests. The first one opened in 1996 on Brigade Road in Bangalore and continues to be one of the most happening places in the city. The youth and the young at heart immediately took to the place. A space that they call their own for a while, sit down, talk and listen to conversations, hold short meetings and mainly have a whole lot of fun over steaming cups of endless coffee. It's been an exciting journey since then, becoming the largest organised retail cafe chain in the country.
